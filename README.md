## Installation

### gulp-ngdocs
gulp-ngdocs 0.2.13 has some issues. I have found that if its installed on its own it works fine, but when installed from this projectâ€™s package.json it may not install properly.  The workaround is to cd into hq/node_modules/gulp-ngdocs and run npm install, or perhaps to install it before running the package.json install.  This issue has been raised at: https://github.com/nikhilmodak/gulp-ngdocs/issues/98

## Mock API
Stubby is used to mock API end points.
```
If stubby is not installed:
  npm install -g stubby

Start the stubby server with:
  stubby -d /path/to/nameofstub.yaml

i.e.:
  cd hq/stub
  stubby -d api.yaml -s 8882 -w
```
