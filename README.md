## Installation

### gulp-ngdocs
gulp-ngdocs 0.2.13 has some issues. I have found that if its installed on its own it works fine, but when installed from this projectâ€™s package.json it may not install properly.  The workaround is to cd into hq/node_modules/gulp-ngdocs and run npm install, or perhaps to install it before running the package.json install.  This issue has been raised at: https://github.com/nikhilmodak/gulp-ngdocs/issues/98
